       <h1>The Evolution of Version Control</h1>
        <p>Modern version control is defined by the rich ecosystem built around Git. Cloud-based hosting platforms like GitHub, GitLab, and Bitbucket have become central to development. GitHub, which launched in 2008 , reported having over 100 million developers by 2023, highlighting the scale of these platforms.</p>
        <p2>These platforms have standardized modern workflows and trends:
        <ol>
            <li><b>Hosting and Collaboration:</b> They provide web-based interfaces for managing repositories and collaborating. The Pull Request (or Merge Request) model has become the standard for proposing, reviewing, and approving code changes before they are integrated.</li>
            <li><b>Automation and Integration:</b> VCS is now at the heart of CI/CD (Continuous Integration/Continuous Delivery) pipelines. Commits to a repository can automatically trigger builds, tests, and deployments, leading to faster and more reliable releases.</li>
            <li><b>Social Coding:</b> These platforms have fostered a "network effect" and "social coding". They make it easy for developers worldwide to discover projects, fork them (make a personal copy), and contribute changes back via pull requests, enabling massive-scale open-source collaboration.</li>
        </ol>
